- how to run the tool :
 
>>> first you should open { your_tokens.json } as a NOTPAD / with any edit tool ...

>>> second : edit the file with your twitter tokens + you should have a twitter developer account (https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard)

Note : the bot won't work without twitter tokens 

>>>>>> if you want to make it post on [facebook page]
       just add your token in { your_tokens.json } and if you don't just leave the token Place Empty and it won't make any problem....
